# This project will have 3 parts.
## 1.A scraper that will extract the data from the [Gwent:The Witcher Card Game website](https://www.playgwent.com/).
### The scraper will extract the following information:
* Stats of Victorys, Losses, Draws, Winrate, and the number number of games played by each player per faction. 



















### I'm doing this only for fun. I won't get any profit for this project.
